# Machine Learning for Materials

## 1. Young's Modulus vs Melting Temperature 
- Young's modulus and melting temperature are correlated each other so to predict youngs modulus and new elements just by taking melting temperature as input
- Linear Regression is used to create model<br>
- ` Expected Plot ` <br> <br> ![Board](https://github.com/Kevin-0-0/Machine_Learning_4_Materials/blob/main/YMvsMT.png)
- It can also be verified that there is linear relationship between youngs modulus and melting temperature and offcourse there is influence of other factors too.
